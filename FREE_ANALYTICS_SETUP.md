# Free Analytics Alternatives

Since you cannot pay for Plausible, here are completely free analytics alternatives:

## Option 1: Umami (Self-Hosted) - Recommended
**Completely Free** - Host on free platforms

### Quick Setup with Vercel (Free)
1. **Fork Umami**: https://github.com/umami-software/umami
2. **Deploy to Vercel**: 
   - Connect GitHub to Vercel
   - Import the forked repo
   - Set environment variables
3. **Add to your site**:
```html
<script async defer data-website-id="YOUR-ID" src="https://your-umami.vercel.app/script.js"></script>
```

### Benefits:
- 100% free forever
- Privacy-focused
- No limits
- Your own data

## Option 2: GoatCounter (Free Hosted)
**Free for non-commercial use**

1. Sign up: https://goatcounter.com
2. Add to index.html:
```html
<script data-goatcounter="https://YOURSITE.goatcounter.com/count"
        async src="//gc.zgo.at/count.js"></script>
```

## Option 3: Counter.dev (Free)
**Simple, privacy-friendly, free**

1. Sign up: https://counter.dev
2. Add tracking code
3. View simple analytics

## Option 4: Google Analytics (Free)
**Most comprehensive, but less privacy-friendly**

Already documented in ANALYTICS_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md

## Option 5: Cloudflare Web Analytics (Free)
**If using Cloudflare (free plan available)**

1. Add site to Cloudflare
2. Enable Web Analytics
3. No code needed!

## Option 6: Remove Analytics
**Simplest option**

Just comment out the Plausible script in index.html:
```html
<!-- <script defer data-domain="nilukush.github.io" src="https://plausible.io/js/script.js"></script> -->
```

## Recommendation
For your use case, I recommend either:
1. **GoatCounter** - Easiest free hosted option
2. **Remove analytics** - Focus on building first
3. **Umami on Vercel** - If you want full control

The Plausible script in your index.html will simply not track anything until you sign up, so you can leave it there for now.
