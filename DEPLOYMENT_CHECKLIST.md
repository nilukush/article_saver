## üìä Post-Deployment

### Monitoring
- [ ] Check Railway metrics dashboard daily for first week
- [ ] Monitor Supabase database usage
- [ ] Set up error tracking (Sentry free tier)
- [ ] Watch GitHub issues for user reports

### Cost Tracking
- [ ] Railway: Monitor usage (should be $0-5/month initially)
- [ ] Supabase: Check storage usage (500MB free)
- [ ] Domain: $0 (using free subdomains initially)
- [ ] Total: Under $5/month for small user base

### User Communication
- [ ] Create announcement for launch
- [ ] Update README with download links
- [ ] Add installation guide
- [ ] Set up support email or Discord

## üö® Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. [ ] Railway: Use "Rollback" button in dashboard
2. [ ] Desktop: Direct users to previous release
3. [ ] Database: Supabase has automatic backups
4. [ ] Communication: Update users via GitHub

## üìà Growth Milestones

Track these metrics to know when to scale:

- **0-100 users**: Current setup is fine
- **100-1,000 users**: Consider Supabase Pro ($25/month)
- **1,000-10,000 users**: Add CDN, monitoring, dedicated support
- **10,000+ users**: Consider dedicated infrastructure

## ‚úÖ Launch Readiness

Before announcing publicly:
- [ ] All deployment steps completed
- [ ] Tested on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- [ ] Auto-updater verified working
- [ ] Backend API responding correctly
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Support channel ready
