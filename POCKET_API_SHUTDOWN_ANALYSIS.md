# 🚨 CRITICAL: Pocket API Shutdown Analysis for Article Saver

## Executive Summary
**The Pocket API situation is AMBIGUOUS and poses a significant risk to your July 8 launch messaging.**

## Timeline & Facts

### Confirmed Dates:
- **May 22, 2025**: Browser extensions already removed from stores
- **July 8, 2025**: Pocket service shuts down, enters "export-only mode"
- **October 8, 2025**: All data permanently deleted

### API Status - The Critical Gap:
Mozilla's official documentation is **UNCLEAR** about API functionality between July 8 and October 8:
- States: "API users will no longer be able to transact data (read or write) over Pocket's API from October 8, 2025"
- Does NOT clarify if APIs work between July 8-October 8

## Risk Analysis

### Scenario 1: APIs Stop on July 8 (Most Likely)
- **Probability**: 70%
- **Impact**: Your import feature stops working the day of your launch
- **Evidence**: "All third-party applications will stop working properly"

### Scenario 2: APIs Continue Until October 8
- **Probability**: 30%
- **Impact**: 3-month window for imports
- **Evidence**: Vague wording about October 8 cutoff

## URGENT Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Actions (Before July 8)
- **Test the API NOW** - Verify current functionality
- **Monitor API Status Daily** - Set up automated checks
- **Prepare Contingency Messaging** - Have alternate marketing ready

### 2. Marketing Strategy Adjustments

#### If APIs Stop July 8:
Change your messaging to:
- "Import your Pocket data BEFORE July 8"
- "Last chance to save your articles"
- Focus on manual export/import process

#### Prepared Statements:
```
Twitter: "⚠️ Pocket shuts down TODAY! If you haven't imported yet, export your data from Pocket and upload to Article Saver. We've got you covered! #PocketShutdown"

LinkedIn: "Today marks the end of Pocket. While direct import may no longer work, Article Saver supports manual import of your exported Pocket data. Don't lose your reading list!"
```

### 3. Technical Contingency Plan

Implement these features IMMEDIATELY:
1. **Manual Import Option**
   - Accept Pocket's CSV/HTML export files
   - Parse and import offline

2. **API Status Checker**
   ```javascript
   // Add to Article Saver
   async function checkPocketAPIStatus() {
     try {
       const response = await fetch('https://getpocket.com/v3/get', {
         method: 'POST',
         headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
         body: JSON.stringify({ consumer_key: 'test', count: 1 })
       });
       return response.status !== 503;
     } catch {
       return false;
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Dynamic UI Updates**
   - Show "Import from Pocket" if API works
   - Show "Upload Pocket Export" if API is down

### 4. Communication Timeline

#### July 5-7 (Weekend Before):
- Test API functionality
- Prepare both versions of marketing materials
- Alert early adopters to import NOW

#### July 8 (Launch Day):
- Check API status at midnight
- Deploy appropriate marketing message
- Update Article Saver UI based on API status

#### Post-July 8:
- If APIs work, emphasize "Limited time - Import before October 8"
- If APIs fail, pivot to "We support Pocket exports"

## Code Changes Needed

### 1. Add Manual Import Feature
```typescript
// backend/src/routes/pocket.ts
router.post('/import-file', upload.single('pocketExport'), async (req, res) => {
  // Parse CSV/HTML export
  // Create articles in database
});
```

### 2. Update UI Conditionally
```tsx
// desktop/src/renderer/components/ImportButton.tsx
const [apiAvailable, setApiAvailable] = useState(true);

useEffect(() => {
  checkPocketAPIStatus().then(setApiAvailable);
}, []);

return apiAvailable ? (
  <Button onClick={importFromAPI}>Import from Pocket</Button>
) : (
  <Button onClick={uploadExport}>Upload Pocket Export</Button>
);
```

## The Bottom Line

**You CANNOT rely on Pocket's API working after July 8.** 

Prepare for the worst-case scenario where the API stops working on launch day. Having manual import ready ensures Article Saver remains valuable regardless of API status.

## Action Items
1. ✅ Test Pocket API immediately
2. ✅ Implement manual import by July 7
3. ✅ Prepare dual marketing messages
4. ✅ Set up API monitoring
5. ✅ Update documentation for both scenarios

This ambiguity is actually an opportunity - position Article Saver as the reliable solution that works whether Pocket's API is available or not.
