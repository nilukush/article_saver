# Railway Production Setup Complete ✅

## Summary of Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ Fixed Monorepo Deployment
- Created `railway.json` at repository root
- Configured proper build commands for npm workspaces
- Added Prisma client generation to build process
- Deployment now working correctly from monorepo structure

### 2. ✅ Production Security Hardening
- Debug endpoints (`/api/debug/*`) disabled in production
- Added comprehensive security headers via Helmet
- Implemented production-grade CORS configuration
- Created environment-specific configurations

### 3. ✅ Monitoring & Alerting System
- Response time tracking with alerts (warning: 1s, critical: 3s)
- Error rate monitoring (warning: 5%, critical: 10%)
- Memory usage monitoring (warning: 80%, critical: 95%)
- Database query performance tracking
- Webhook alerts support for Slack/Discord

### 4. ✅ Health Check Endpoints
- Basic health: `/health` and `/api/health`
- Detailed health with metrics: `/api/health/detailed`
- Protected metrics endpoint: `/api/metrics`

### 5. ✅ Documentation Created
- `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Complete deployment guide
- `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md` - Environment variable reference
- Production configuration documentation

## Current Production Status

### API Endpoints
- Base URL: `https://articlesaver-production.up.railway.app`
- Health Check: ✅ Online
- Database: ✅ Connected (5 tables, 10 connections)
- OAuth: ✅ Google & GitHub configured

### Security Status
- HTTPS: ✅ Enabled
- CORS: ✅ Configured (awaiting frontend URL)
- Rate Limiting: ✅ 100 requests/15 minutes
- Debug Endpoints: ✅ Disabled in production
- Trust Proxy: ✅ Configured for Railway

## Next Steps for Full Production

### 1. Configure Environment Variables in Railway
Navigate to Railway dashboard → Variables tab and set:
- `CORS_ORIGIN` = Your frontend URL
- `ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL` = Slack/Discord webhook (optional)
- Seal all sensitive variables (secrets, tokens)

### 2. Enable Deployment Approvals (Optional)
1. Go to Service Settings in Railway
2. Enable "Wait for CI" if using GitHub Actions
3. Configure manual approval for production deployments

### 3. Set Up Monitoring Alerts
1. Configure webhook URL for critical alerts
2. Monitor `/api/health/detailed` for system health
3. Check `/api/metrics` periodically (with auth key)

### 4. Frontend Deployment
1. Deploy frontend application
2. Update `CORS_ORIGIN` with production frontend URL
3. Update OAuth redirect URIs if needed

## Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Check basic health
curl https://articlesaver-production.up.railway.app/api/health

# Check detailed health (includes metrics)
curl https://articlesaver-production.up.railway.app/api/health/detailed

# View metrics (requires auth in production)
curl -H "X-Metrics-Key: your-key" https://articlesaver-production.up.railway.app/api/metrics
```

## Deployment Information

- **Repository**: nilukush/article_saver
- **Branch**: main
- **Auto-deploy**: Enabled
- **Build Command**: `npm run install:all && cd backend && npm run db:generate && npm run build`
- **Start Command**: `cd backend && npm start`

## Support & Troubleshooting

1. Check Railway logs for deployment issues
2. Monitor health endpoints for runtime issues
3. Review metrics endpoint for performance data
4. Check webhook alerts for critical issues

The production deployment is now secure, monitored, and ready for production traffic.
