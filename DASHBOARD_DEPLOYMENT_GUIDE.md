# Add modified files
git add index.html
git add README.md
git add DOWNLOAD_DASHBOARD_GUIDE.md

# Verify what's staged

```

### Step 3: Commit Changes

Create a descriptive commit message:

```bash
git commit -m "Add live download statistics dashboard

```

### Step 4: Push to GitHub

Push your changes to the main branch:

```bash
git push origin main
```

### Step 5: Verify GitHub Pages is Enabled

1. Go to: https://github.com/nilukush/article_saver/settings/pages
2. Check that GitHub Pages is enabled:
   - **Source**: Deploy from a branch
   - **Branch**: `main`
   - **Folder**: `/ (root)`
3. If not enabled, configure these settings and click "Save"

### Step 6: Wait for Deployment

GitHub Pages typically deploys within 2-5 minutes. You can check deployment status:

1. Go to: https://github.com/nilukush/article_saver/actions
2. Look for a workflow run titled "pages build and deployment"
3. Wait for the green checkmark ‚úÖ

### Step 7: Test the Dashboard

Once deployed, test these URLs:

1. **Main Dashboard**: https://nilukush.github.io/article_saver/dashboard/
2. **From Homepage**: https://nilukush.github.io/article_saver/ (click "üìä Stats" in nav)
3. **Direct API Test**: https://api.github.com/repos/nilukush/article_saver/releases

### Step 8: Verify Features

Check that the dashboard shows:
- [ ] Total download count
- [ ] Downloads this week
- [ ] Latest version downloads
- [ ] Platform distribution chart
- [ ] Version comparison chart
- [ ] Growth timeline
- [ ] Auto-refresh every 5 minutes
- [ ] Privacy notice

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Not Loading?

1. **Check GitHub Pages Status**:
   ```bash
   curl -I https://nilukush.github.io/article_saver/dashboard/
   ```
   Should return `200 OK`

2. **Clear Browser Cache**:
   - Chrome: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
   - Or open in Incognito/Private mode

3. **Check Console Errors**:
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Check Console tab for errors

### 404 Error?

1. Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled (Step 5)
2. Check you pushed to the correct branch
3. Wait 5-10 minutes for propagation
4. Try: https://nilukush.github.io/article_saver/dashboard/index.html

### No Data Showing?

1. **API Rate Limit**: GitHub allows 60 requests/hour for unauthenticated requests
2. **CORS**: Should work fine on github.io domain
3. **Check API directly**: https://api.github.com/repos/nilukush/article_saver/releases
