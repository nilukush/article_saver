## üí≠ Philosophical Approach

Remember: **Successful companies started with worse domains**:
- Facebook started as `thefacebook.com`
- Twitter was `twttr.com`
- Dropbox couldn't get dropbox.com initially

**Focus on**:
1. Building great product
2. Getting users
3. Generating revenue
4. THEN perfect domain

## üéØ Final Recommendation

**For your situation (no budget):**

1. **TODAY**: Launch on `https://articlesaver.github.io`
   - Cost: $0
   - Professional enough
   - Can migrate anytime

2. **WHEN YOU HIT $100 REVENUE**: Buy `article-saver.com`
   - Cost: $9/year
   - Best ROI
   - Most trusted TLD

3. **FUTURE**: Add domains as you scale
   - Only buy what you can afford
   - Track which domains drive traffic
   - Don't overextend

## üìù Key Takeaways

1. **You DON'T need a custom domain to start** - GitHub Pages is perfectly professional
2. **Cloudflare is cheapest** when you do buy domains
3. **Start with .com only** - it's the most recognized
4. **Your product matters more than your domain**
5. **Free can be professional** with the right approach

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Set up GitHub Pages TODAY (30 minutes)
2. Launch your landing page
3. Start getting users
4. Buy domain when you have revenue

Remember: Airbnb started as `airbedandbreakfast.com`. The domain doesn't make the company - the product and execution do.

**You've got this! üéØ**
