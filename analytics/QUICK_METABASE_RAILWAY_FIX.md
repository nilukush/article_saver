# Quick Fix for Railway Metabase OOM Error

## Option 1: Add Memory Optimization (Try This First)

1. In Railway dashboard, click your **Metabase** service
2. Go to **Variables** tab
3. Add these environment variables:

```bash
# Reduce Java heap size for free tier
JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx400m -Xms256m -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=256m

# Disable unnecessary features
MB_EMOJI_IN_LOGS=false
MB_COLORIZE_LOGS=false
MB_ANON_TRACKING_ENABLED=false
MB_APPLICATION_LOGO_URL=false
```

4. Click **Deploy** button

## Option 2: Use Smaller Metabase Version

Change the Docker image to a lighter version:

1. In **Settings** → **Source**
2. Change image from `metabase/metabase:latest` to:
   ```
   metabase/metabase:v0.47.0
   ```
   (Older version uses less memory)

## Option 3: Quick Database-Only Setup

Since you have only 2 users, you could:

1. **Cancel** the Metabase deployment on Railway
2. Use the PostgreSQL that already deployed successfully
3. Connect to it with:
   - DBeaver (free)
   - TablePlus (free tier)
   - pgAdmin (free)
   - Your local Metabase

## Option 4: Free Alternatives That Work

### A. Render.com (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Go to https://render.com
# 2. Click "New+" → "Web Service"
# 3. Connect GitHub
# 4. Use Docker image: metabase/metabase:latest
# 5. Select "Free" instance type (512MB RAM but optimized better)
```

### B. Use Local + Ngrok for Sharing
```bash
# Run Metabase locally
java -jar metabase.jar

# Expose it publicly with ngrok (free)
ngrok http 3000
```

## If You Want to Stay on Railway

You need to upgrade:
- **Hobby Plan**: $5/month (8GB RAM included)
- Metabase will run perfectly

## My Recommendation

1. **Right now**: Use your local Metabase (already running)
2. **Tomorrow**: Deploy to Render.com (better free tier)
3. **Next month**: If you like it, get Railway Hobby plan

The Railway free tier is just too limited for Metabase. Most users hit this issue.
