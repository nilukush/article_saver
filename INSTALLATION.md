## üöÄ After Installation

1. **Launch Article Saver**
2. **Click "Import from Pocket"** in Settings
3. **Authenticate with your Pocket account**
4. **Wait for import to complete** (progress shown in header)

## üîÑ Auto-Updates

Article Saver will automatically check for updates every hour. When an update is available:
- You'll see a notification
- Click "Restart to Update" when prompted
- The app will update and restart automatically

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### "Unidentified Developer" or "Unknown Publisher" warnings
These warnings appear because this is an urgent release without code signing certificates. The app is safe to use - these warnings are standard for unsigned applications.

### Cannot open on macOS
- Make sure to right-click and select "Open" for first launch
- Check System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí General
- Try running: `xattr -cr /Applications/Article\ Saver.app` in Terminal

### Linux permission denied
```bash
chmod +x Article.Saver-1.1.3.AppImage
```

### Windows Defender blocks the app
- This is rare but can happen with unsigned apps
- Add an exception in Windows Defender
- Or use the portable version instead of installer

## üîí Security Note

**Why is this app unsigned?**
Due to the urgent Pocket shutdown deadline (July 7, 2025), we've released this version without code signing certificates to ensure you can import your articles in time. Code signing requires:
- Apple Developer Program enrollment ($99/year) with 1-2 week processing
- Windows EV Certificate ($300-500) with 1-3 week processing

Future releases will be properly signed. The source code is open and available for review at https://github.com/nilukush/article_saver.
